The space itself is stunning, filled with local art and cozy creative energy. It’s the kind of place that feeds both your body and your soul.\n" +

        "What made this visit truly unforgettable was my server Ilianna. She went above and beyond with her kindness, attention to detail, and amazing recommendations. I felt genuinely cared for, not just served. The rest of the staff and the owner Kate were also warm and passionate about what they do and it shows.\n" +

    review: "Wow, what an incredible experience! I had breakfast with my friends and from the moment we arrived, we felt so welcomed. They even opened the door a few minutes early when they saw us waiting outside, which set the tone right away. The seating area is beautiful, the art is amazing, and the atmosphere truly feels like being in Europe. The food was fresh and delicious, and the coffee had such a unique, wonderful flavor. Overall, it was a beautiful experience that made us feel right at home. I’ll definitely be coming back and recommending this place to all my friends and family!",
